    The make_simulator_class creates a new Simulator class as used by both the
    Python and C++ simulator backend. It injects the given step_math function
    into a wrapper that performs additional type checking.

    Parameters
    ==========

    step_math:
        The actual step_math function provided by the simulator backend.
    params_som_:
        The somatic parameters that should be stored in the Simulator class.
    params_den_:
        The dendritic parameters that should be stored in the Simulator class.
    dt_:
        The simulation timestep.
    ss_:
        The number of subsamples per timestep used by the simulator.
